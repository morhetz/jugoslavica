# Jugoslavica

Keyboard Layout Simplifying Slavic Latin Diacritics Input

## Why Not Stick with the Default Layout?

Let's break it down. The standard layout doesn't quite match up with the
familiar Latin QWERTY we're used to. There's a bit of a learning curve, and
those extra characters **(Č, Ć, Đ, Š, Ž)** overlap the
punctuation keys. It becomes especially frustrating if you find yourself
typing more often in English than in Serbo-Croatian. This can pose a significant
headache for programmers.

## What's the Solution?

This layout offers the option to conveniently access accent characters by
utilizing a separate input level, accessible through the `⌥ Opt` key. So, this
not only facilitates typing in Serbo-Croatian but also caters to the broader
range of the Slavic Latin alphabet.

## What's Included?

* For Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian: **Č (Ч), Ć (Ћ), Đ (Ђ), Š (Ш), Ž (Ж)**

* Montenegrin extras: **Ś** and **Ź**

* Macedonian: **Č (Ч), Ǵ (Ѓ), Ḱ (Ќ), Š (Ш), Ž (Ж)**

* [Bulgarian][1]: **Ă (Ъ)**

* Old Church Slavonic: **Ě (Ѣ), Ĭ (Ь), Ŭ (Ъ), ϴ (Ѳ), Ÿ (Ѷ)**

* [Belarusian][2]: **Č (Ч), Š (Ш), Ž (Ж), Ć (Ць), Ś (Сь), Ź (Зь), Ń (Нь), Ŭ (Ў), Ł (Л)**

* Added for consistency, Czech: **Ř**
